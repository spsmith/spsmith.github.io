My name is Simon Smith, and I am a Systems Programmer at the Virtual Environments group, Wisconsin Institute for Discovery. I graduated from UW-Madison with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science along with a certificate in Digital Studies in December 2015. I've been a programmer for various projects in the lab since the end of 2016.

My main areas of expertise are Unity development and Python scripting. I've also done work with C++, R, and other languages, as well as non-programming tasks such as 3D scanning, running focus groups, and many other activities as needed for our research.

The **Civil Engineering Project** is a work-in-progress software experience designed to teach Engineering students how to read and understand building plans. It is an interactive quiz that takes place while exploring a 3D building model on an Oculus headset. [Read more...](pages/CivilEngineering.html)

## [3D Technology for Crime Scene Investigation](pages/3DCSI.html)

![Crime scene house dataset]({{'images/csh.png' | absolute_url}})

This two-year project focused on the use of 3D capture technology for crime scene investigation. Using the lab's LiDAR scanner, datasets of various mock crime scenes were captured. Working with the **Dane County Sheriff's Office** and the **UW-Madison LaFollette School of Public Affairs**, this data was used to construct a cost benefit analysis in order to determine the efffectiveness of this technology for crime scene investigators.
