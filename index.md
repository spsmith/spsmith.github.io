My name is **Simon Smith**, currently a Software Engineer at **Microsoft**. I've been working on the [IVAS augmented reality system](https://news.microsoft.com/transform/u-s-army-to-use-hololens-technology-in-high-tech-headsets-for-soldiers/) since August 2021.

From 2016 to 2021, I was a Systems Programmer for the Virtual Environments Group, located in the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery. I served as lead developer for several ongoing research projects at the lab, which you can learn more about below. I graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science in December 2015.

I am an experienced **Unity** developer for desktop and virtual reality platforms. My main programming languages are **C#** and **Python**; I also have experience with C++, C, R, Lua, and others. My work has also involved 3D modeling, digital asset creation, LiDAR scanning, running focus groups, and many other activities.

The **UW Virtual Brain Project** is an ongoing research project designed to test the effectiveness of virtual reality-based learning. It is developed in Unity and runs on desktop platforms as well as the Oculus Rift, Quest, and Go. I was the lead developer on this project and assisted in the project's design since it's inception.

## [Civil Engineering Project (VR for EDU)](pages/CivilEngineering.html)

![Civil Engineering image]({{'images/WID-VE/Engineering/steel_frame.jpg' | absolute_url}})

The **Civil Engineering Project** is a software experience designed to teach engineering students how to read and understand building plans. It is an interactive quiz that takes place while exploring a 3D building model on an Oculus headset. I was the lead developer for this project, working alongside engineers to implement their 3D data and teaching materials. [Read more...](pages/CivilEngineering.html)

## [3D Technology for Crime Scene Investigation](pages/3DCSI.html)

![Crime scene house dataset]({{'images/WID-VE/CSI/csh.png' | absolute_url}})

This two-year NIJ-funded project focused on the use of 3D capture technology for crime scene investigation. Using a LiDAR scanner, datasets of various mock crime scenes were captured. Working with the **Dane County Sheriff's Office** and the **UW-Madison LaFollette School of Public Affairs**, a cost benefit analysis was created determining the efffectiveness of this technology for crime scene investigators. I was one of three developers on this project, focusing on algorithm design as well as data collection. [Read more...](pages/3DCSI.html)
