The **Civil Engineering Project** is a work-in-progress software experience designed to teach Engineering students how to read and understand building plans. It is an interactive quiz that takes place while exploring a 3D building model on an Oculus headset.

Building models are provided by the Engineering team in SketchUp format, and then imported into Unity. Various pieces of the structure, as marked in the building plans, must be located and identified by the user.
