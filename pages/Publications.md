# 3D CSI

My work on the 3D CSI project resulted in two publications:
- [A Cost-Benefit Analysis of 3D Scanning Technology for Crime Scene Investigation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2665910719300258) *(Forensic Science International: Reports, Volume 1, November 2019)*
- [Methods for Detecting Manipulations in 3D Scan Data](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1742287619301793) *(Digital Investigation, Volume 30, September 2019)*

# UniCAVE

My contributions to the UniCAVE project were included in a poster presented at IEEE VR 2017:
- [Uni-CAVE: A Unity3D plugin for non-head mounted VR display systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7892342) *(IEEE Annual International Symposium Virtual Reality (2017))*

# UW Virtual Brain Project

Two papers regarding the UW Virtual Brain Project have been submitted for publication and are in revisions. One covers the experiment design and results from the first three Virtual Brain experiments. The other covers the design of the program itself. Links will be posted here when they are available.
